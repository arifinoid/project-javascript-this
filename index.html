      <h1>BREAKING: Jokowi wins second term, CSIS-Cyrus quick count shows</h1>
      <p>
        A quick count conducted by the Center for Strategic and International
        Studies and Cyrus Network indicates that President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo
        has been reelected to the presidency, with the Jokowi-Ma’ruf Amin ticket
        winning <span id="csis1"></span> percent of the vote against Prabowo
        Subianto-Sandiaga Uno’s <span id="csis2"></span> percent.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 5:03 pm, local time, data from 86.7 percent of the polling
        stations surveyed had been received. The margin of error from the quick
        count is 1 percent. A quick count conducted by Jakarta-based pollster
        Charta Politika also shows similar results with Jokowi-Ma’ruf winning
        <span id="cp1"></span> percent against Prabowo-Sandiaga’s
        <span id="cp2"></span> percent, with 83.8 percent of 2,000 polling
        stations surveyed.
